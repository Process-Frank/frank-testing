  Since the collection MAY have a tag filter, let's just remove that by fetching
  the collection object again
{%- endcomment -%}
{%- assign coll = collections[collection.handle] -%}
<script type="text/javascript">
  window.Collections = window.Collections || {};
  window.Collections[{{ coll.handle | json }}] = {%- include 'tool.json-collection' with { collection: coll, includeProductData: true } -%};
</script>
